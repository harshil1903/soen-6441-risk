Created a common gameEngine from map engine and gameengine (removed old mapengine and gameengine)
transfered control from main class to gameengine class for entire game
State pattern for better state handling
command pattern for commands
moved game related functions to game utils
added temp order inside player class to fetch order while issueing it without any arguments or return value


old issue order method used to take order input from player class, removed it.

deploy order function was inside player class, removed it
